# Deepfake-Detection-using-Mesonet
Deepfake Detection in images using Mesonet network architecture.
Our system is made of tensorflow, keras, pytorch and open CV.

Training Set:
- Forged Images: 5111
- Real Images: 7250
  
Validation Set:
- Forged Images: 2889
- Real Images: 4259
Balance:
- Both sets maintain a balanced distribution between forged and real images, ensuring comprehensive training
and validation.
Purpose:
- The dataset serves to train the model to recognize deepfake patterns and validate its performance before real-
world deployment
